### Purpose: Study the transcriptome of the annual aestivation cycle in sea cucumbers

Rough Outline 
* take respiratory, intestine, and mesentry tissue sample 
* sample at least 3 sea cukes from summer, spring, and winter
* look for differentially expressed genes
* look for msmb genes 

Goal: try to identify potential genes responsible for aestivation homoestatis, intiation, and gut regeneration
hypothesis: some genes will be differentially expressed

experimental design to-do list:
* [ ] determine sample size in order to achieve maximum statistical power, as in how many biological replicates do we need
* [ ] determine some of the statistical tests that will be performed on the data. ie monte carlo, grn inference, etc
* [ ] figure out when to sample cukes. This winter, spring, summer, fall
* [ ] figure out cost estimates, ie multiplexing etc
* [ ] create step by step process for tissue sampling, rna preping, and library prepping
* [ ] figure out sequencing depth needed 
* [ ] How many kits will I need for tissue prep?
  * rna extraction
  * rna purification
  * polyA enrichment
  * indexing
  * library prep
* [ ] how do I do QC for samples?

Notes about transcriptomic sequencing

2x150 bp is referring to the library prep kit used. 2x is saying there are two sequences on either end of the spacer. the 150 bp is the size of each sequence. I think. 

Because of ribosomal rna concentrations, some prep has to be done to remove it. PolyA enrichment or ribsomal rna depletion are the two common methods.
