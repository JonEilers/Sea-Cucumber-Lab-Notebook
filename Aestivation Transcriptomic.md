### Purpose: Study the transcriptome of the annual aestivation cycle in sea cucumbers

Rough Outline 
* take respiratory, intestine, and mesentry tissue sample 
* sample at least 3 sea cukes from summer, spring, fall, and winter
* look for differentially expressed genes
* look for msmb genes 

Goal: try to identify potential genes responsible for aestivation homoestatis, intiation, and gut regeneration
hypothesis: some genes will be differentially expressed

experimental design to-do list:
* [ ] determine sample size in order to achieve maximum statistical power, as in how many biological replicates do we need
* [ ] determine some of the statistical tests that will be performed on the data. ie monte carlo, grn inference, etc
* [ ] figure out when to sample cukes. This winter, spring, summer, fall
* [ ] figure out cost estimates, ie multiplexing etc
* [ ] create step by step process for tissue sampling, rna preping, and library prepping
* [ ] figure out sequencing depth needed
