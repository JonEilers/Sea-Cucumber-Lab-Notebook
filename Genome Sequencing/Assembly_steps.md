### initial assembly steps 
* quality control and pre-processing
  * remove barcodes
  * remove poor quality reads
  * filter duplicates

   * Hybrid approach
    * Assembly guided by a reference genome of a closely related organism
    ### probably the approach I want to take
   ~~~
    * AlignGraph
   ~~~
* assembly improvement  
  * polishing:
   Fixing short indels and miscalls
   * Software: PILON, IMAGE2
  * gap filling:
   Remove N's and extending contig ends
   * Software: Sealer (ABySS), PILON, GMcloser, IMAGE2 •
  * contig integration:
   merging two assemblies
  * automated snp calling for reference guided assemblies
* Assembly quality assesment
 * Software: Quast, SuRankCo, qaTools
