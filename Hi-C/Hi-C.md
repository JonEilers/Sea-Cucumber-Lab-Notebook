### Resources and other bits regarding using Hi-C for genome sequencing

#### Thoughts
It can be used to create chromosome level scaffolds which is really cool. What sort of validation is required (optical mapping/staining/etc)? 
Can the genome be directly assembled from Hi-C without aligning to a reference genome? 

> restriction enzymes cut at certain sites. The ends of othe resulting fragments are ligated together and the crosslinking dissolved. 
> The fragments are then sequenced. This means that some percentage of each contig will be from distals parts of the chromosome. 
> In short, I think a reference/draft genome is required first before doing Hi-C. Need to read more
