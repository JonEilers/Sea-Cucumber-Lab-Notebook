Thoughts regarding in vivo crispr experiment for sea cucumbers

------------------------
Questions - Can sea cucumbers get cancer

Methods:
1. induce evisceration in cucumbers until they can't eviscerate anymore
	* hypothesis is if they are induced frequently, their recovery time will increase and they will lose mass until they die
2. design a crispr-cas9 system to edit known cancer causing genes and 
	* delivery method
		* electroporation - might induce evisercation. If not, this could be directed at specific parts of the cucumber internal organs. If so, this might be ideal as the cells responsible for regeneration are most likely to be active at this point and suspectible to transfection
		* hydrodynamic delivery - easy, probably wouldn't make them evisercate? Non-specific and might require high concentrations of crispr cas9? 
	* list of genes - how many are needed?

3. verification
	* formation of teratoma which would require editing of specific transcription factors. If it doesn't form, there is no way to verify it actually didn't happen?
	* add gfp into crispr cas9 gene editing. If gene responsible for the regen process are edited, then gfp should show up in the regenerated gut
