Tested water for nitrate and nitrites. Both were at or extremely close to 0 ppm. No test kit for ammonia. 
Kits are old and probably need to purchase new kits

Checked water salinity using the refractometer provided by Dr. Onthank
Cooler salinity was about 27-28 ppm
Water in buckets were 35ish and 50ish ppm respectively
I siphoned out fecal matter and other debrie on the bottom. Approximately 1-2 gallons. I replaced with water from buckets. 
After adding water from buckets, salinty was increased to approxmiately 30 ppm.
