### 4/8/2019

switched to keeping water quality records in a write in the rain notepad. Sea cucumbers produce a lot of ammonia, even when they aren't being fed... 

Performed surgery on a cuke today to see if gonads could be extracted through a small incision next to the head. Notes and observations: anesthetize the cuke next time using menthol or chlorobutanol. The cuke moved around a lot while I was trying to make an incision. It was difficult to cut all the way through once the cuke contracted and the body wall thickened. However, if the cuke was completely relaxed I suspect the body wall would be fairly easy to cut through. I did remove some of the gonads through the incision, but the cuke also eviscerated and I removed the rest through the anus. Liezel sutured the cuke back up using needle and thread that is normally used for suturing up human wounds. She used the standard superficial wound stitch. I played with some of the gonads and was able to push sperm out of the tubes. I collected the gonads in one tube and the guts in another for freezing at -80 C. After the cuke was sutured up it was placed back in the cuke container and observed for a little bit to see how it was doing. It moved around and even performed feeding behavior. Found several papers with different chemicals for anesthetizing cukes. Also found a paper on freezing sea cuke sperm and specifically that the sperm was extracted from the gonads by mashing them on a .5 mm mesh. 

### 3/17/2019

> * 50% water change today
> * added spirulina and chlorella 
> * cut and mashed up raw oyster, shrimp. placed them within mesh and placed rocks to keep them submerged
> * Ammonia ~.5 ppm
> * Nitrate ~ 5 ppm

After skimming numerous papers, I found that sea cucumbers definitely have food preferences. Specifically for bacteria and small algae. I also found papers looking at parastichopus californicus distribution and surface preference. They strongly prefer solid, rocky surfaces for feeding. This explains the preference for the side of the tank instead of the gravel and snad substrate. I added more rocks and will eventually find some bigger rocks to add. When the spirulina and chlorella was added the sea cucumbers immediately became active and began feeding. 12 hrs later shrimp, oyster, and nori were added to the bottom. The sea cucumbers appear to be ignoring it so far and opting to feed on the algae and bacteria forming on waterline in the tank. One technique for feeding sea cucumbers is making a plaste and putting it on corrugated plastic and then into the water. I checked ammonia levels 8ish hours later and it was .5 ppm. I will need to keep an eye on the ammonia levels over the next few days until I figure out how to feed them. 

I was reading spirulina/chlorella have the ability to metabolize nitrates in the dark. 

I am also thinking of ways to create a sand or pumice filter us a small plastic container with holes poked it in and an air pump to create some kind of flow. 

N0 further eviscerations. I think I will move the airstones back to the side of the tank as it seems to encourage biofilm growth which means food fror the cukes

> * Salinity: ~35 ppm
> * Ammonia: ~ .25-.5 ppm
> * Nitrate: ~ 5 ppm
> * Temperature: ~ 10 C
> * 25% water change @ 1200
> * another 25% water change planned for this evening

4 sea cucumbers were collected from rosario March 10, 2019. They were transported to Walla Walla University that day. Two airstones were added to the water and a 50% water change was done. A few days later 10 lbs of aquarium sand, 5 lbs of aragonite, and several rocks were added. The next day the sea cucumbers pooped in various places around the tank. Some looked like it was the white sand that I had added the previous day and others were dark grey sediment from rosario. The sea cukes are usually on the tank wall when I check daily. the two air stones were located next to the tank walls and I noticed biofilms were developing where the airstones were bubbling. The next day the sea cukes were all in that location feeding. After reading about the role sediment plays in their digestion I moved the two airstones to the center of the tank in the hopes it would encourage the sea cukes to spend more time on the sediment. The next day one had eviscerated. I collected the gonads, digestive tract, and respiratory track and froze them at -80 C for later DNA extraction. Based on the gonads, the eviscerated cuke appears to be female. All cukes appear to be active and "feeding" so I cannot determine which one evisercated. I tried to hand feed them some of bottom feeder pellets. One looked like it tried to eat, the other sorta opened its mouth but then closed it. I added some flake fish food as the pellets may not dissociate enough for the cukes to eat whereas the flake food might break apart and provide easier food for the cukes.

Note the various feces of different colors situated around the tank. One hypothesis for the evisceration is maybe a cuke was on the bubble stone and become frightened? Otherwise, ammonia levels are too high and salinity is within reason. Maybe there is also something in the sediment? The eviscerated digestive tract was empty upon inspection. 

### 2/6/2019

checked ammonia/nitrate. Ammonia about the same, nitrates are down. Refractometer arrived. Calibrated it and test salinity of the cooler. Was at 21ish ppm, which seemed low. So I checked it with Onthank's. His was about 4 ppm higher. So I checked the calibration on his and it was off. So it works. I added 600 ml (1.5lbs) more salt. 

Sidenote: if Onthank's refractometer was 4-5 ppm high. That means the cukes were living in 20-23 ppm water for most of the time. O.O 

### 2/4/2019

checked ammonia/nitrate. ammonia might be up a smidge from yesterday. Hard to tell with nitrates. added some parmesan garlic stacy pita chips to the mix. water temp was at 12 C. Asked Nestler for a refractometer. 

### 2/3/2019

Whelp, it appears to be working. I didn't test the water in the cooler yesterday, but there is definitely ammonia and nitrates. Way more nitrates than ammonia. So something is going well. I added five bits of dog kibble to give the bacteria something to eat. Might get some fish food to supplement later. Also might begin doing water changes. Note to self, need to order a refractometer too. Temp in the cooler was 15 C. Note - high water temp for deception pass area is 14 C, winter is about 5 C. So the temp for the cukes last quarter was about what they would experience in the summer. heh

### 2/2/2019* 

After all the sea cucumbers died, the bodies were either frozen or disposed of. The cooler-aquarium-tank set up was taken down and cleaned. Today I set it back up. In three weeks we will be collecting more sea cucumbers and I wanted to try and get the bacterial population settled before introducing new cukes. Some changes were made.
1. gravel substrate was added to the bottom. 
2. 4.5 lbs of (1500 mls) were added to the water. there was roughly 25 gallons of freshwater.
3. tested the ammonium and nitrate levels of the water in the cooler which original transported the cukes. There was both. Indicating there might be some bacteria still alive in there. I added about a gallon of that water to the newly set up cooler in the hopes it will colonize the filter and substrate. 
4. cucumber proofed the intakes in the manner that worked previously. 

### Goals for these cukes include - harvesting gametes, testing surgery procedures, karyotypes, and DNA extraction methods 


### 12/28/2018

After returning from christmas break, the two remaining cukes were very very very dead and dissolving. Probably salinity. Will have to order a refractometer for sea cuke stuff in the future so this doesn't happen again. Also develop a fool proof routine for making sure I know what the water change water always is. 

### 12/23/2018

Sooooo, terrible day. While doing the water change i noticed one of the was balled up in the centered and hadnt moved. I picked it up and realized it was dead and starting to dissolve at the ends. I removed it and dissected it as seen in the photos below. I wonder if the reason why it was balled up in the center is that the cells were still alive and attempting to get away from the parts of the animal that was dead? Strange idea though. I began rhe water change and noticed the texture and color of the water i was adding did not look salty so i tasted the second bucket and found it to be freshwater. The refractormeter was locked in the education building. I added salt directly to the cooler water. The cukes freaked out and began to thrash in the water when the salt touched them. Second cup of salt i mixed with water before adding and by then the cukes had settled down somewhat. I poured in the first bucket of water before i realized i needed to check id salt had been added so i dont know if i added too much salt. I added the amount needed to bring the two buckets up to 28 ppm. The remaining two cukes may be dead by the time i return from christmas in bellingham.

### 12/21/2018

> temp ~ 12-13 C, ammonia ~ 2 ppm

at least one of the cukes is feeding and it appears to be pooping now. I moved one cuke to see if it had its mouth tentacles out and it landed on another cuke. A scaleworm on it then jumped ship to the other cuke. Cold room thermometer read as under 10 C, which is strange as it was reading at 12 - 13 C for awhile. The thermometer in the cuke water still reads 12 - 13 C.

### 12/18/2018

> temp 12 C, ammonia 2-3 ppm

One of the cukes stuck its mouth on the filter intake and managed to have its tissue slowly pulled through the mesh. I took it out and after trying to separate it without hurting it, I tore tissue off. After deciding it was going to die, I dissected it to observe the digestive track. As can be scene in the images below, it appears the gut was about halfway regenerated with both respiratory tree and reproductive organs present. Two of the other cukes appear to be exhibiting feeding behaviors at this time too. Two days ago I added three pieces of dog kibble. I removed two today. I attempted a fix on the filter intake by zip tying a small container with wholes in it over the intake. See photo below.

### 12/16/2018

> temp 12 C, salinity ~ 30 ppm, ammonia 2 ppm

one sea cucumber had a large lesion on side with white decaying flesh bordered the lesion. It was limp when I picked it up. I assumed it was dead and began dissecting it to see if the gut had begun regenerating since I increased water temperature. As can be seen in the photos, not much if any gut regeneration has occured as far as I can tell. I did a 10 gallon water change and placed 3 pieces of dog food in the water. I would like to make slides of the sea cucumber tissue if possible. I will look at stain types and if we have a vibratome or other tools for slicing tissue

> #### before water change 
> * salinity ~ 31 ppm

> * nitrate ~ 0 ppm
> * water temp ~ 13 Celsius

> #### after water change
> * ammonia ~ .5 ppm

Measured nitrate, ammonia, salinity, and water temp. Checked salinity in water change buckets and adjusted the salinity to approx 30 ppm then did a 10 gallon water change which reduced ammonia from 2 ppm to .5 ppm. After water change, I added three pieces of dog kibble as food for sea cukes. I will check ammonia levels over the next few days. I poked the sea cukes with a plastic tube and observed the body walls to be thin and most likely lacking internal organs.

set the temp at 45 F. hopefully that will put the water temp between 12 C and 13 C. breathing rate of one of the sea cukes is at roughly 1 anal sphincter opening/30 seconds

@0905

Yeesh, I need to down size these photos before uploading them....

> water temp is at 13-14 Celsius. 

Cukes are showing elevated respiration rates as evidenced by increased anal sphincter opening/closing. Will begin adding dog food as soon as I do the next water change. Need respiratometer to check salinity.

Will do a water change later today when i have acquired the refractometer

Also i want to buy a endoscope for observing internal organs. Will look into cost.

Ammonia test

Some sea cucumbers are looking thin. I think they need food but the water temp is too low for them to activily feed. I turned up the water temp by a 2-3 C using the thermostat on the inside. This is off by about 8-10 C so it should raise the water temp to 12-13 C. Hopefully enough to allow the cucumbers to move more. Once i see they are active i will. Egin feeding them.

Observation.
They respond to light stimuli when i entered today, two of them began waving their anterior end i  the water and moving away from the surface.

Makes me think the bacteria in the filter are either not present or converting the ammonia to nitrate. Weird. Did a partial water change. Salinity refractometer was not present and i dont know where it was. Used all the water from the bucket with salinity of 35ish ppm and then added half a bucket of water from the tapwater hose. Sea cucumbers were sloughing skin prior to water change. Not sure what that means. No other obvious signs of stress.

Divided the high salinity bucket between two buckets and topped them off with tap water. Should put the salinity at roughly 25 ppm

~~~
One was exposing its anterior end to the water surface. Feeding tentacles retracted. Another was on the container floor with its posterior end twisted so the tube feet were exposed. I have noticed this behavior before, the cuke was fine.
~~~



### 11/27/2018
> Checked in on sea cucumbers, they look happy. 

~~~ 
Observation
I have noticed multiple times at this point that there will usually be at least one or two sea cucumbers
that have lifted the anteior part of their body into the water with their mouth parts pointed up. 
Why do they do this?They will also do this when close to the water surface. 

One or two will also react to the the light and begin swaying the raised part of the body
~~~

Current water temperature is sitting around 10-13 C. I am considering raising the temperature to what would be considered summer temperature in the hopes to stimulate activity and begin feeding them. Currently no food has been added. They were acquired early november. The collectors stated most sea cucumbers were dormant and not moving when collected. However, after collecting they have maintained slow and lethargic movement around the aquarium. Two died due to being sucked into exposed intake tubes. One more eviscerated shortly there after. I suspect it was due to exposure to biological compounds from the dead sea cucumber that was inadvertently left over night in the aquarium.
