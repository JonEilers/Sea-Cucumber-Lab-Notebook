checked ammonia/nitrate. Ammonia about the same, nitrates are down. Refractometer arrived. Calibrated it and test salinity of the cooler. Was at 21ish ppm, which seemed low. So I checked it with Onthank's. His was about 4 ppm higher. So I checked the calibration on his and it was off. So it works. I added 600 ml (1.5lbs) more salt. 

### 2/4/2019

checked ammonia/nitrate. ammonia might be up a smidge from yesterday. Hard to tell with nitrates. added some parmesan garlic stacy pita chips to the mix. water temp was at 12 C. Asked Nestler for a refractometer. 

### 2/3/2019

Whelp, it appears to be working. I didn't test the water in the cooler yesterday, but there is definitely ammonia and nitrates. Way more nitrates than ammonia. So something is going well. I added five bits of dog kibble to give the bacteria something to eat. Might get some fish food to supplement later. Also might begin doing water changes. Note to self, need to order a refractometer too. Temp in the cooler was 15 C. Note - high water temp for deception pass area is 14 C, winter is about 5 C. So the temp for the cukes last quarter was about what they would experience in the summer. heh

Side note: Early photos taken of what appears to be skin sloughing off the a cuke resembles spawninging in male sea cucumbers. Hard to tell from the photo, but definitely something to note for future observations. See video link below

### 2/2/2019

After all the sea cucumbers died, the bodies were either frozen or disposed of. The cooler-aquarium-tank set up was taken down and cleaned. Today I set it back up. In three weeks we will be collecting more sea cucumbers and I wanted to try and get the bacterial population settled before introducing new cukes. Some changes were made.
1. gravel substrate was added to the bottom. 
2. 4.5 lbs of (1500 mls) were added to the water. there was roughly 25 gallons of freshwater.
3. tested the ammonium and nitrate levels of the water in the cooler which original transported the cukes. There was both. Indicating there might be some bacteria still alive in there. I added about a gallon of that water to the newly set up cooler in the hopes it will colonize the filter and substrate. 
4. cucumber proofed the intakes in the manner that worked previously. 

### Goals for these cukes include - harvesting gametes, testing surgery procedures, karyotypes, and DNA extraction methods 


### 12/28/2018

After returning from christmas break, the two remaining cukes were very very very dead and dissolving. Probably salinity. Will have to order a refractometer for sea cuke stuff in the future so this doesn't happen again. Also develop a fool proof routine for making sure I know what the water change water always is. 

### 12/23/2018

Sooooo, terrible day. While doing the water change i noticed one of the was balled up in the centered and hadnt moved. I picked it up and realized it was dead and starting to dissolve at the ends. I removed it and dissected it as seen in the photos below. I wonder if the reason why it was balled up in the center is that the cells were still alive and attempting to get away from the parts of the animal that was dead? Strange idea though. I began rhe water change and noticed the texture and color of the water i was adding did not look salty so i tasted the second bucket and found it to be freshwater. The refractormeter was locked in the education building. I added salt directly to the cooler water. The cukes freaked out and began to thrash in the water when the salt touched them. Second cup of salt i mixed with water before adding and by then the cukes had settled down somewhat. I poured in the first bucket of water before i realized i needed to check id salt had been added so i dont know if i added too much salt. I added the amount needed to bring the two buckets up to 28 ppm. The remaining two cukes may be dead by the time i return from christmas in bellingham.

### 12/21/2018

> temp ~ 12-13 C, ammonia ~ 2 ppm

at least one of the cukes is feeding and it appears to be pooping now. I moved one cuke to see if it had its mouth tentacles out and it landed on another cuke. A scaleworm on it then jumped ship to the other cuke. Cold room thermometer read as under 10 C, which is strange as it was reading at 12 - 13 C for awhile. The thermometer in the cuke water still reads 12 - 13 C.

### 12/18/2018

> temp 12 C, ammonia 2-3 ppm

One of the cukes stuck its mouth on the filter intake and managed to have its tissue slowly pulled through the mesh. I took it out and after trying to separate it without hurting it, I tore tissue off. After deciding it was going to die, I dissected it to observe the digestive track. As can be scene in the images below, it appears the gut was about halfway regenerated with both respiratory tree and reproductive organs present. Two of the other cukes appear to be exhibiting feeding behaviors at this time too. Two days ago I added three pieces of dog kibble. I removed two today. I attempted a fix on the filter intake by zip tying a small container with wholes in it over the intake. See photo below.

### 12/16/2018

> temp 12 C, salinity ~ 30 ppm, ammonia 2 ppm

one sea cucumber had a large lesion on side with white decaying flesh bordered the lesion. It was limp when I picked it up. I assumed it was dead and began dissecting it to see if the gut had begun regenerating since I increased water temperature. As can be seen in the photos, not much if any gut regeneration has occured as far as I can tell. I did a 10 gallon water change and placed 3 pieces of dog food in the water. I would like to make slides of the sea cucumber tissue if possible. I will look at stain types and if we have a vibratome or other tools for slicing tissue

> #### before water change

> #### after water change
> * ammonia ~ .5 ppm

Measured nitrate, ammonia, salinity, and water temp. Checked salinity in water change buckets and adjusted the salinity to approx 30 ppm then did a 10 gallon water change which reduced ammonia from 2 ppm to .5 ppm. After water change, I added three pieces of dog kibble as food for sea cukes. I will check ammonia levels over the next few days. I poked the sea cukes with a plastic tube and observed the body walls to be thin and most likely lacking internal organs.

set the temp at 45 F. hopefully that will put the water temp between 12 C and 13 C. breathing rate of one of the sea cukes is at roughly 1 anal sphincter opening/30 seconds

@0905

Yeesh, I need to down size these photos before uploading them....

> water temp is at 13-14 Celsius. 

Cukes are showing elevated respiration rates as evidenced by increased anal sphincter opening/closing. Will begin adding dog food as soon as I do the next water change. Need respiratometer to check salinity.

Will do a water change later today when i have acquired the refractometer

Also i want to buy a endoscope for observing internal organs. Will look into cost.

Some sea cucumbers are looking thin. I think they need food but the water temp is too low for them to activily feed. I turned up the water temp by a 2-3 C using the thermostat on the inside. This is off by about 8-10 C so it should raise the water temp to 12-13 C. Hopefully enough to allow the cucumbers to move more. Once i see they are active i will. Egin feeding them.

Observation.
They respond to light stimuli when i entered today, two of them began waving their anterior end i  the water and moving away from the surface.

Makes me think the bacteria in the filter are either not present or converting the ammonia to nitrate. Weird. Did a partial water change. Salinity refractometer was not present and i dont know where it was. Used all the water from the bucket with salinity of 35ish ppm and then added half a bucket of water from the tapwater hose. Sea cucumbers were sloughing skin prior to water change. Not sure what that means. No other obvious signs of stress.

Divided the high salinity bucket between two buckets and topped them off with tap water. Should put the salinity at roughly 25 ppm

~~~
One was exposing its anterior end to the water surface. Feeding tentacles retracted. Another was on the container floor with its posterior end twisted so the tube feet were exposed. I have noticed this behavior before, the cuke was fine.

### 11/27/2018
> Checked in on sea cucumbers, they look happy. 

~~~ 
Observation
I have noticed multiple times at this point that there will usually be at least one or two sea cucumbers
that have lifted the anteior part of their body into the water with their mouth parts pointed up. 
Why do they do this?They will also do this when close to the water surface. 

One or two will also react to the the light and begin swaying the raised part of the body
~~~

Current water temperature is sitting around 10-13 C. I am considering raising the temperature to what would be considered summer temperature in the hopes to stimulate activity and begin feeding them. Currently no food has been added. They were acquired early november. The collectors stated most sea cucumbers were dormant and not moving when collected. However, after collecting they have maintained slow and lethargic movement around the aquarium. Two died due to being sucked into exposed intake tubes. One more eviscerated shortly there after. I suspect it was due to exposure to biological compounds from the dead sea cucumber that was inadvertently left over night in the aquarium.
