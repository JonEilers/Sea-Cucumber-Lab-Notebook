> temp ~ 12-13 C, ammonia ~ 2 ppm

at least one of the cukes is feeding and it appears to be pooping now. I moved one cuke to see if it had its mouth tentacles out and it landed on another cuke. A scaleworm on it then jumped ship to the other cuke.

> temp 12 C, ammonia 2-3 ppm

One of the cukes stuck its mouth on the filter intake and managed to have its tissue slowly pulled through the mesh. I took it out and after trying to separate it without hurting it, I tore tissue off. After deciding it was going to die, I dissected it to observe the digestive track. As can be scene in the images below, it appears the gut was about halfway regenerated with both respiratory tree and reproductive organs present. Two of the other cukes appear to be exhibiting feeding behaviors at this time too. Two days ago I added three pieces of dog kibble. I removed two today. I attempted a fix on the filter intake by zip tying a small container with wholes in it over the intake. See photo below.

### 12/16/2018

> temp 12 C, salinity ~ 30 ppm, ammonia 2 ppm

one sea cucumber had a large lesion on side with white decaying flesh bordered the lesion. It was limp when I picked it up. I assumed it was dead and began dissecting it to see if the gut had begun regenerating since I increased water temperature. As can be seen in the photos, not much if any gut regeneration has occured as far as I can tell. I did a 10 gallon water change and placed 3 pieces of dog food in the water. I would like to make slides of the sea cucumber tissue if possible. I will look at stain types and if we have a vibratome or other tools for slicing tissue

> #### before water change 
> * salinity ~ 31 ppm
> * ammonia ~ 2 ppm
> * nitrate ~ 0 ppm
> * water temp ~ 13 Celsius

> #### after water change
> * ammonia ~ .5 ppm

Measured nitrate, ammonia, salinity, and water temp. Checked salinity in water change buckets and adjusted the salinity to approx 30 ppm then did a 10 gallon water change which reduced ammonia from 2 ppm to .5 ppm. After water change, I added three pieces of dog kibble as food for sea cukes. I will check ammonia levels over the next few days. I poked the sea cukes with a plastic tube and observed the body walls to be thin and most likely lacking internal organs.

set the temp at 45 F. hopefully that will put the water temp between 12 C and 13 C. breathing rate of one of the sea cukes is at roughly 1 anal sphincter opening/30 seconds

@0905

Yeesh, I need to down size these photos before uploading them....

> water temp is at 13-14 Celsius. 

Cukes are showing elevated respiration rates as evidenced by increased anal sphincter opening/closing. Will begin adding dog food as soon as I do the next water change. Need respiratometer to check salinity.

Sea cucumber look fine. Looking skinny. I adjusted the thermostat setting a few degree warmer.

> checked ammonia and temp levels. Ammonia ~ 2ppm still and temp 10 C. 

Will do a water change later today when i have acquired the refractometer

Also i want to buy a endoscope for observing internal organs. Will look into cost.

Some sea cucumbers are looking thin. I think they need food but the water temp is too low for them to activily feed. I turned up the water temp by a 2-3 C using the thermostat on the inside. This is off by about 8-10 C so it should raise the water temp to 12-13 C. Hopefully enough to allow the cucumbers to move more. Once i see they are active i will. Egin feeding them.

Observation.
They respond to light stimuli when i entered today, two of them began waving their anterior end i  the water and moving away from the surface.

Makes me think the bacteria in the filter are either not present or converting the ammonia to nitrate. Weird. Did a partial water change. Salinity refractometer was not present and i dont know where it was. Used all the water from the bucket with salinity of 35ish ppm and then added half a bucket of water from the tapwater hose. Sea cucumbers were sloughing skin prior to water change. Not sure what that means. No other obvious signs of stress.

Divided the high salinity bucket between two buckets and topped them off with tap water. Should put the salinity at roughly 25 ppm

One was exposing its anterior end to the water surface. Feeding tentacles retracted. Another was on the container floor with its posterior end twisted so the tube feet were exposed. I have noticed this behavior before, the cuke was fine.

> Checked in on sea cucumbers, they look happy. 

~~~ 
Observation
I have noticed multiple times at this point that there will usually be at least one or two sea cucumbers
that have lifted the anteior part of their body into the water with their mouth parts pointed up. 
Why do they do this?They will also do this when close to the water surface. 

One or two will also react to the the light and begin swaying the raised part of the body
~~~

Current water temperature is sitting around 10-13 C. I am considering raising the temperature to what would be considered summer temperature in the hopes to stimulate activity and begin feeding them. Currently no food has been added. They were acquired early november. The collectors stated most sea cucumbers were dormant and not moving when collected. However, after collecting they have maintained slow and lethargic movement around the aquarium. Two died due to being sucked into exposed intake tubes. One more eviscerated shortly there after. I suspect it was due to exposure to biological compounds from the dead sea cucumber that was inadvertently left over night in the aquarium.
