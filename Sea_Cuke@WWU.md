> Checked in on sea cucumbers, they look happy. 

~~~ 
Observation
I have noticed multiple times at this point that there will usually be at least one or two sea cucumbers
that have lifted the anteior part of their body into the water with their mouth parts pointed up. 
Why do they do this?They will also do this when close to the water surface. 

One or two will also react to the the light and begin swaying the raised part of the body
~~~

Current water temperature is sitting around 10-13 C. I am considering raising the temperature to what would be considered summer temperature in the hopes to stimulate activity and begin feeding them. Currently no food has been added. They were acquired early november. The collectors stated most sea cucumbers were dormant and not moving when collected. However, after collecting they have maintained slow and lethargic movement around the aquarium. Two died due to being sucked into exposed intake tubes. One more eviscerated shortly there after. I suspect it was due to exposure to biological compounds from the dead sea cucumber that was inadvertently left over night in the aquarium.

> * Tested water for nitrate and nitrites. Both were at or extremely close to 0 ppm. No test kit for ammonia.

Nitrate test


> * Kits are old and probably need to purchase new kits

> * Checked water salinity using the refractometer provided by Dr. Onthank
> * Cooler salinity was about 27-28 ppm
> * Water in buckets were 35ish and 50ish ppm respectively
> * I siphoned out fecal matter and other debrie on the bottom. Approximately 1-2 gallons. I replaced with water from buckets. 
> * After adding water from buckets, salinty was increased to approxmiately 30 ppm.
