> Daily check up: temp on the thermometer in the cooler said roughly 11 degree celsius. 

Sea cucumber look fine. Looking skinny.

> checked ammonia and temp levels. Ammonia ~ 2ppm still and temp 10 C. 

Will do a water change later today when i have acquired the refractometer

Also i want to buy a endoscope for observing internal organs. Will look into cost.

Ammonia test

Some sea cucumbers are looking thin. I think they need food but the water temp is too low for them to activily feed. I turned up the water temp by a 2-3 C using the thermostat on the inside. This is off by about 8-10 C so it should raise the water temp to 12-13 C. Hopefully enough to allow the cucumbers to move more. Once i see they are active i will. Egin feeding them.

This is the new thermostat temp i set

Observation.
They respond to light stimuli when i entered today, two of them began waving their anterior end i  the water and moving away from the surface.

> used university credit card from onthank to purchase ammonia teat kit. Ammonia levels were at 2 ppm. Nitrate levels were zero. Water temp was 10 Centrigrade

Makes me think the bacteria in the filter are either not present or converting the ammonia to nitrate. Weird. Did a partial water change. Salinity refractometer was not present and i dont know where it was. Used all the water from the bucket with salinity of 35ish ppm and then added half a bucket of water from the tapwater hose. Sea cucumbers were sloughing skin prior to water change. Not sure what that means. No other obvious signs of stress.

Divided the high salinity bucket between two buckets and topped them off with tap water. Should put the salinity at roughly 25 ppm

> Checked on cukes, they look happy. Did not check temp.

> Checked on cukes, they look happy

> water temp = 10Â° C

~~~
One was exposing its anterior end to the water surface. Feeding tentacles retracted. Another was on the container floor with its posterior end twisted so the tube feet were exposed. I have noticed this behavior before, the cuke was fine.

> Checked in on sea cucumbers, they look happy. 

~~~ 
Observation
I have noticed multiple times at this point that there will usually be at least one or two sea cucumbers
that have lifted the anteior part of their body into the water with their mouth parts pointed up. 
Why do they do this?They will also do this when close to the water surface. 

One or two will also react to the the light and begin swaying the raised part of the body
~~~

Current water temperature is sitting around 10-13 C. I am considering raising the temperature to what would be considered summer temperature in the hopes to stimulate activity and begin feeding them. Currently no food has been added. They were acquired early november. The collectors stated most sea cucumbers were dormant and not moving when collected. However, after collecting they have maintained slow and lethargic movement around the aquarium. Two died due to being sucked into exposed intake tubes. One more eviscerated shortly there after. I suspect it was due to exposure to biological compounds from the dead sea cucumber that was inadvertently left over night in the aquarium.

> * Tested water for nitrate and nitrites. Both were at or extremely close to 0 ppm. No test kit for ammonia.

> * Kits are old and probably need to purchase new kits

> * Checked water salinity using the refractometer provided by Dr. Onthank
> * Cooler salinity was about 27-28 ppm
> * Water in buckets were 35ish and 50ish ppm respectively
> * I siphoned out fecal matter and other debrie on the bottom. Approximately 1-2 gallons. I replaced with water from buckets. 
> * After adding water from buckets, salinty was increased to approxmiately 30 ppm.

Happy sea cucumber!
